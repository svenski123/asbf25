In tools and code that dynamically creates selectors from function prototypes it is conceivable that inadvertent methods could be called. For example, deploying a contract that dispatches an invalid selector created where 'uint' has not been canonicalised to 'uint256' and then through some callback method that takes the function prototype as a string and computes the hashed selector value itself, cause the unexpected method to be called.
